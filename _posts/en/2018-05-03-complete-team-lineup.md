Do you have players who want to play regularly but not enough to add a new team to your league? No problem for League2GO! You can add a new team to your league and the missing players will be automatically filled by the substitutes of your league.

To enable this feature, it's very simple. Enable the "Specify target number of players per team" setting and configure the targets for each position. Then create your team and add the regular players. When the search for substitutes starts for this game, League2GO will automatically add slots to fill for the missing players. Also, if the number of players for a position exceeds the configured target, no substitute will be contacted.

If you have any questions or comments please contact us at [info@league2go.com](mailto:info@league2go.com).
