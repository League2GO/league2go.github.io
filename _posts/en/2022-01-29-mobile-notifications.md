<br/>
<br/>
* **Double check your device settings** and the League2GO notification settings
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

### I received the email "Your mobile notifications no longer work"

If you received an email form us informing you that your push notifications no longer work, open the app and look for "diagnose push notications" at the top of the menu.

<br/>

### Sending a test push

If you suspect push notifications are not working, you can send yourself a test notification. 

1. In the app, open the menu, and go to your profile
2. Scroll to the bottom to "Send a push"
3. Open the "Send a push" popup and send yourself a push.

Then you will receive a confirmation push notication on your device.

<br/>
<div class="image-container-row">
{% include image.html src="2022-01-29-mobile-notifications-profile-ios-fr.png" caption="Profile" %}
{% include image.html src="2022-01-29-mobile-notifications-test-ios-fr.png" caption="Sending a test push" %}
</div>
<br/>

### Last resort

As a last resort, uninstall and re-install the League2GO app. At login, activate push notifications, then, you will receive a confirmation push notication on your device.
