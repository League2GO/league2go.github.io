You can now assign ​a​ jersey number to players of your team. You only have to modify the player and enter the number. Jersey numbers are displayed ​next to a player's name.

​You can also change the number of a player for only a game from the drop down menus in the game details. From these menus you can also enter jersey numbers for substitutes.
