The mobile application League2GO (a must!) now supports push notifications to offer you the best mobile experience. Since they are even faster than SMS, you will have a better chance of getting the available space in the next game you want to play.

If you do not have data on your phone, emails and SMS are still supported.

We've also added notifications to the app so you can easily find a previously received game request.
