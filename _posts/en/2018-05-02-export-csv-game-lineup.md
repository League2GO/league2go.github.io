It is now easy to note the statistics of your games by exporting the lineup to a CSV file. Open a game's page and click the "Export Alignment" button to start downloading the file. The team, the jersey number, name, position and ranking will be exported for each player. Once downloaded, open the file in a spreadsheet to easily note the information of the game.
