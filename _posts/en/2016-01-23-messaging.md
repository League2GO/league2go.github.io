title: "New feature! Messaging for managers"

Today, we add the possibility for managers to send messages to players of a league, team or game. If you have to notify your players of a schedule change, you just have to create a new message, using the league management tools. In two clicks, the message will be sent to every recipient that you have selected. That means you no longer have to contact each player individually or use a mailing list.

Depending on their communication preferences, players will receive an email or a SMS specifying that a message has been sent to them. The complete content of the message is included in the emails while only the title and a link to the complete message content is sent by SMS.

When a player logs in the web site and has an unread message, a notification is displayed over the Messages menu. From this menu, players can read their recent messages.
