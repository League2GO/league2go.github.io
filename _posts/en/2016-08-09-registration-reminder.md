When you add players who don’t have an account on League2GO, they receive a welcome email or SMS with a registration link. Many lose that message and when they want to warn you that they can’t play a game, they contact you so that you declare their absence. From now on, we send an automatic reminder to players who did not complete their registration after a week. Players will be able to use this message to register and then themselves declare their absence.

If you have any questions or comments please contact us at [info@league2go.com](mailto:info@league2go.com).
