With League2GO, we have options for every need. We present to you a series of articles about less known features to improve the management of your league.

#### 1. Parameter not to substitute each absence

You don't want League2GO to automatically replace each absence? You can specify a minimal number of players to reach before automatic substitutions. Check the Target number of players per team in the General tab of your league parameters.

#### 2. Team logos and colors

In the Teams tab of your league, click on the gears icon of a team to unveil the parameters of this team. With these parameters, you can configure a color to easily recognize the team in the pages. Also, add a logo to offer visibility to your partners or simply customize your league.

#### 3. Advanced notifications for managers

In the Notifications tab of the settings of your league, you can activate notifications that will be sent to you if a player declares his absence, if a player is substituted automatically or if any substitute could be found.
