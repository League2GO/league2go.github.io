title: "New feature! - Improved game management"

We added several new features that improve game management to offer more control and simplify the interfaces. A new menu regroup the actions of each game spot such as replacing a player, start an automatic search of substitutes or recall substitutes. From this menu, managers can also add new game spots for other players to each game. These game spots can be automatically filled by substitutes to play with teams that are not complete.

Managers can optimize their alignment by replacing an absent player by another player of the team. For example, if your pitcher is absent, he can be replaced by a fielder and then the fielder can be automatically replaced by a substitute.

Last update, substitutes can choose their team when there is a free game spot in each team. The button to replace an absent player has been moved from the top of the game information to each game spot to clarify the position of the substitute and in which team he will play.
