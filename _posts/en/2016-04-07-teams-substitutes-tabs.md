Some adjustments were made to league management pages in order to simplify players management. The “Players” tab was replaced by two new tabs. The “Teams” tab gather all the team management actions as well as actions, to manage regular players. The “Substitute” tab allows the management of the substitutes bank of the league or of every team.
