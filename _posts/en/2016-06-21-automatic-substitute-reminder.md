Today, we offer you even more automated league management tools. A new league configuration has been added allowing automatic game reminder for substitutes who did not answer. For example, if your league is configured to send substitution requests a week before games, you can now send an automatic reminder two days before the start of the game. You no longer have to send reminders manually!
