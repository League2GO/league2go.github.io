To inform you of the possibilities of League2GO, we write a series of articles about less known features. You can read the first part [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/less-known-features-part1).

#### 1. Season Management

From the Seasons tab of your league parameters, you can add seasons that will categorize the schedule of your games, statistics and standing. The information of previous seasons can be viewed from the drop-down menu.

#### 2. Period where a player cannot declare his absence

From the Substitutes tab of your league parameters, you can determine a number of hours before the game where players cannot declare their absence themselves.

#### 3. Favorite substitutes

Select the star that is beside each substitute to design them as favorite substitutes. They will be contacted before other substitutes when a player must be replaced. You can configure the delay between the messages sent to favorites and normal substitutes in the parameters of your league. Only the managers can see and modify substitutes.

#### 4. Do not disturb period

In the settings of your league, you can specify a period that will prevent automated messages to your players. Go to the Substitutes tab and then activate the do not disturb period. The messages will be sent after the period. The configured delays between favorite substitutes and normal substitutes are respected.
