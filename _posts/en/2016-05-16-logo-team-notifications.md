title: "New feature! - Logos and notifications for team"
lang: en
localization: logo-team-notifications
---
League2GO now allows you to personalize your league and manage the notifications of each team. First of all, the captain or the manager can customize the league by adding a logo to every team. Logos are featured on team pages, on the calendar, the standings page and in the game details.

We also add the possibility to configure the notifications for each team. It allows to inform only the team captain when a player is absent, replaced or when no substitute has been found. If they want to, managers can still receive these notifications for all the league.
