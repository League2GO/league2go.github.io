Statistics with League2GO are easy and entirely configurable. From the _Results_ tab of your league parameters, you can determine the information that will be entered to each game. That information will allow you to have more or less detailed standing and statistics according to your need. You can, for example, choose to enter penalties, time of goals and faceoffs. Then, in the _Statistics_ tab of your league parameters, decide which statistics to display to your players. If you desire to keep the information for managers only, you can disable the display of statistics to players.

A new _Results_ tab has been added to games. From this tab, you can enter the goals, penalties as well as the statistics of each player. You can enter the information live with a tablet of a mobile phone. When the data of a game is entered, players can access to the _Results_ tab to consult the information.

Finally, from the _Statistics_ tab of your league, you can consult the player statistics. Players can access this information from the main menu.
