As of now, regular players can pay their season fees online at League2GO. No need to collect cash anymore! The money is transferred directly to your account and you can track each player's payouts directly through your league's management interface. We use Stripe payment technology for unparalleled security and simplicity.

In order for payment to work, you must first set up your league on the website. Then, you will be able to generate season fees to be paid online and players will have the option of paying through the League2GO website or mobile application. In this article, we first walk you through the simplicity of payment and then show you how to set up your league.

### Creating a season fee (League manager)

Once your league is configured to accept online payments, to generate a season fee, simply go to the “Billing” tab of the league management interface, then click on “Save a season fee. season"

Next, you must enter the desired income for the league. The amount loaded to each player, including the $ 0.30 + 2.9% collected by Stripe, will automatically be displayed on the right. If necessary, a due date and a note can be added to the payment. When everything is configured, tap “Add”.
